# Covid19-Analysis
Analysis of How Worldwide Happiness is Affecting Covid19 Infection.

In this Project I am working with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, consisting of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country.

Also we have a “Worldwide happiness report” consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country over the world. 

I have merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of  the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
